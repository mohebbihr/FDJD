Here, we describe a fusion detection method using RNA-Seq data which takes advantage of both these two approaches. This method aligns RNA-Seq input data to the reference genome to identify discordantly mapping reads like a mapping-first approach. Additionally, it converts discordant reads into a novel binary fingerprint format which makes it possible to quickly and accurately search the reference human genome for fusions. This fusion detection pipeline contains three steps: general alignment, fusion candidate generation, and refinement.
